### Hello world 👋 I am Limuelle!

- 🏫 I'm currently studying computer science at the University of the Philippines Visayas.
- 🌐 I'm interested on web and mobile development. 
- 💻 I'm currently learning different frameworks and technologies to widen my skillset.
- 🎨 I also enjoy wireframing, learning UI/UX, and improving my overall design skills.
- 🏆 2022 Goals: Collaborate with other developers and join a hackathon.
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I usually go by Lim and when added to my last name becomes a palindrome, thus, my username 😉
